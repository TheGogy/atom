# NNUE - from stockfish

This NNUE has been taken (and adapted slightly) from the [Stockfish github](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master). While I would like to create my own NNUE from scratch, as this would allow me to fully utilise the strengths of my own engine and give me full control of the training data and method, this is very computationally expensive and I do not have the resources (or time) to do so, given that this engine is mainly a fun hobby project.

This NNUE evaluation is not my code, and the network that it is running is not my data. Both of those belong to the Stockfish authors and community.

The latest networks can be found on [Stockfish's NNUE network repo](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns).
