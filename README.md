## Inspiration

Move generation takes a lot of inspiration from [VincentBab](https://github.com/vincentbab)'s [Belette](https://github.com/vincentbab/Belette/), as well as [Daniel inf√ºhr](https://github.com/Gigantua)'s [Gigantua](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5313417/Worlds-fastest-Bitboard-Chess-Movegenerator), as well as many techniques from the [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Generation).

Perft tests from [Elcabesa](https://github.com/elcabesa)'s engine, [Vajolet](https://github.com/elcabesa/vajolet).
