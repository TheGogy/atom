# Atom

A basic chess bot written as a fun / learning / hobby project in C++. Still in development, expect many bugs!

> [!NOTE]
> This bot does not have time control support; it will run indefinitely. To play it, you should manually set a max search depth.

Current perft score (i5-11400H @ 4.5GHz):
- starting position (depth 7): 3195901860 nodes, 4250 ms, 751976908 nps
- kiwipete position (depth 7): 374190009323 nodes, 274811 ms, 1361626751 nps

## Installation

Requires g++ compiler. Some parts (i.e memory) may only work on linux.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thegogy/atom
cd atom
wget https://tests.stockfishchess.org/api/nn/nn-68207f2da9ea.nnue # Big nnue
wget https://tests.stockfishchess.org/api/nn/nn-37f18f62d772.nnue # Small nnue
make release
```
Ensure that the NNUE files are in the base directory (the same as this README) and *not* the src directory.

## Inspiration

Move generation takes a lot of inspiration from [VincentBab](https://github.com/vincentbab)'s [Belette](https://github.com/vincentbab/Belette/), as well as [Daniel inf√ºhr](https://github.com/Gigantua)'s [Gigantua](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5313417/Worlds-fastest-Bitboard-Chess-Movegenerator), as well as many techniques from the [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Generation).

[perft_massive](./tests/perft_massive.txt) from [Elcabesa](https://github.com/elcabesa)'s engine, [Vajolet](https://github.com/elcabesa/vajolet).

NNUE from [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/). For more information, see [the NNUE readme in this repo](./src/nnue/README.md).

## Todo

- Time management
- EGTB pruning
- Testing for search
